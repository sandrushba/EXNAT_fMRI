**All test pictures (as pngs) for the Ishihara-style colour vision test.** 

I use these 4 colours as font colours in the experiment:

- violet: 
		- RGB: rgb(210, 146, 243)
		- HEX: #D292F3
- pink:
		- RGB: rgb(249, 137, 162)
		- HEX: #F989A2
- blue:
 		- RGB: rgb(42, 183, 239)
		- HEX: #2AB7EF
- green:
		- RGB: rgb(136, 186, 63)
		- HEX: #88BA3F
		
Tool for creating color images in the style of Ishihara colour vision test plates: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hex-to-rgb.html

--> this is just the tool without any code or information on the "author"
There is an older version with a README here, though: https://github.com/hakrackete/Ishihara-color-plate-generator

I used these specifications: 

- coloushift: 0% 
- brightness: 0% 
- gradientshift: 0%

*Hint: This is NOT a test for the colour sight deficiencies, itâ€™s only testing whether the participants can distinguish the colours used in the experiment!
Idea: Maybe use additional Ishihara test images?*
