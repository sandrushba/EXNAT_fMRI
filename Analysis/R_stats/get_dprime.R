#' Get Dprime (d')

#' Computes Signal Detection Theory index d'
#'
#' @param n_hit Number of hits.
#' @param n_fa Number of false alarms.
#' @param n_miss Number of misses.
#' @param n_cr Number of correct rejections.
#' 
#' @return Calculates the d-prime for a given vector with hits, misses, false alarms & correct rejections.
#'
#' Returns the following index:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\strong{dprime (d')}: }{The response sensitivity index. Is calculated by sutracting the Z-value of the false-alarm rate from the Z-value of the hit-rate.}
#'  }
#'
#' Note that for d', adjustement for extreme values (hit or false alarm rates of 0 or 1) are made by replacing them by 0.01 or 0.99, respectively, following one the recommandations of Macmillan & Creelman (1991).

  # Adjust hit rate & false alarm rate so we don't get problems with extreme values
  # (i.e. when hit or false alarm rate = 0 or 100)
  
  # There are multiple ways you can adjust the hit & false alarm rates:
  
  # Option 1: Use a non-parametric statistic such as A' instead of d' (Craig, 1979) 
  # --> Nope, I want the more widely known d-prime.
  
  # Option 2: Aggregate data from multiple subjects before calculating 
  #           the statistic (Macmillan & Kaplan, 1985)
  # --> Nope, I want individual d-primes.
  
  # Option 3: Add 0.5 to both the number of hits and the number of false alarms, 
  # and add 1 to both the number of signal trials and the number of noise trials; 
  # dubbed the loglinear approach (Hautus, 1995)
  # --> Nope, only suitable for equal target to non-target-ratios.
  #     Here's a nice explanation in Jeff's answer:
  #     https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134779/d-prime-with-100-hit-rate-probability-and-0-false-alarm-probability
  
  # Option 4: Adjust only the extreme values by replacing rates of 0 with 0.5 / n
  # and rates of 1 with (n - 0.5) / n 
  # where n is the number of signal or noise trials (Macmillan & Kaplan, 1985)
  # --> Problem: This is not working well with a low number of trials.
  
  # Option 5: Define 0/0 to be 0 (Fienberg, 1977: 109)
  # --> What. No.
  
  # Option 6: Set hit or false alarm rates of 0 [1] to 0.01 [0.99].
  # --> I like this one best.
  # Sources for this approach:
  # From Iverson (1996; doi:10.1121/1.415234): "The z transform
  # reaches infinity when percentages equal 0 or 100, so tokens
  # with 0% /l/ identifications were assigned values of 1% and
  # tokens with 100% /l/ identifications were assigned values of
  # 99% (Macmillan and Creelman, 1991)."
