Calculate word frequencies for EXNAT Pilot1

Input: 1 csv file containing 3 columns: 
    - word (with single words w/o punctuation)
    - text_nr (1_01 - 1_09 and 2_01 - 2_16)‚
    - word_frequency (all set as 0)

Output: The same csv, but with a word frequency 
       (in the column word_frequency) for each word.
